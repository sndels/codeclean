Code cleaning

Part 1: Basic functionality
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I'll start by implementing a bare-bones version of comment removal from a
single input file to refine it before diving into child processes. This will be
done as a single function taking a filename as its argument and the implementa-
tion is likely split to reasonable chunks after a working version is formed.
The basic architecture will be minimal at this point as I've yet to familiarize
myself with the boilerplate needed for the "additional" features of the task.

The cleaning function developed into reding a fixed length of characters and
keeping a simple state to handle longer lines and comment blocks. At this point,
the program takes a single file as a command line and removes comments as well
as empty lines (first character '\n') from it. Comments spanning over read buf-
fers and starting or ending at the border of buffers are also handled as needed.
A log file is created for operations of interest (beginnings, ends of comments,
detection of empty lines).
